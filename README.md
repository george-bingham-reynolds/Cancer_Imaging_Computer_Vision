The accompanying notebook in this repo contains the code and outputs for my final project for Applied Deep Learning from the Fall semester of 2022, part of my Master's in Data Science program from Columbia Univrsity (preceded by the course's description of the project and starter code). The purpose of the project is to develop an end-to-end prototype of a computer vision model designed to detect tumors in medical slide images. Please note that due to data limitations the expectation for this project was not create a production-worthy product; rather, it was to have a working codebase for an end-to-end solution that could potentially be used with a more robust dataset in the future.
